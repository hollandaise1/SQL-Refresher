# SQL-Refresher
SQL Refresher using PostgreSQL
- How to remove duplicates?
- How to use LEFT JOIN and WHERE safely?
- What are the types of the joins we have? And when to use them?
- When to use IN and when to use EXISTS? How about LIKE? Is there a NOT LIKE?
- Review Window Function
- Review INDEX
- Optimization techniques

### üîç Additional Advanced SQL Concepts to Review

1. **Set Operations**

   * `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
   * Use cases: deduplication, mutual inclusion/exclusion logic

2. **Aggregation with `GROUP BY` & `HAVING`**

   * Nested aggregation
   * Filtering post-aggregation using `HAVING`

3. **Subqueries**

   * Correlated vs uncorrelated subqueries
   * `EXISTS`, `IN`, `NOT IN`, `ALL`, `ANY`

4. **Advanced Window Functions**

   * `LEAD`, `LAG`, `NTILE`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`
   * Frame specifications: `ROWS BETWEEN`, `RANGE BETWEEN`

5. **Pivoting/Unpivoting**

   * CASE-based pivot logic
   * `PIVOT`, `UNPIVOT` (if your SQL dialect supports it)

6. **Recursive CTEs**

   * Tree/graph traversal
   * Hierarchical queries (e.g., org charts, file systems)

7. **Date & Time Manipulation**

   * `DATE_DIFF`, `DATE_ADD`, `EXTRACT`, formatting
   * Use in time-based windows or rollups

8. **Conditional Logic**

   * `CASE WHEN`, especially nested
   * Useful for encoding business rules

9. **Query Optimization & Performance**

   * Indexing awareness
   * Explain plans, avoiding cross joins, filtering early

10. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

* NULL handling (`COALESCE`, `NULLIF`)
* String ops: `LIKE`, `REGEXP`, `TRIM`, `SPLIT`, etc.
